# AgentBar

A native macOS menu bar app plus a zero-config Claude Code plugin. When a Claude Code
agent needs something from you — a multiple-choice question, a permission prompt, or it
has gone idle waiting for input — AgentBar notifies you and brings your terminal back to
the front so you can answer there. It is a **notification tool, not an input tool**: it
never blocks your session and never sits between you and Claude.

## How it works

```
Claude Code session → plugin hook → AgentBar local server → menu bar / banner
        │                              (returns immediately)
        └── session continues; you answer the prompt in your terminal
```

1. The plugin registers hooks across Claude Code's interaction points: questions
   (`AskUserQuestion`), permission requests, MCP input requests (`Elicitation`), idle
   notifications, and the task-finished / subagent-finished / session-ended /
   run-interrupted (`Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `SessionEnd`, `StopFailure`) events.
2. When one fires, the bundled `bin/agentbar-hook` script reads the payload and POSTs it
   to AgentBar's local HTTP server (`127.0.0.1`, ephemeral port, per-launch bearer token
   published to `~/Library/Application Support/AgentBar/server.json`). It launches the
   app first if it is not already running.
3. The server acknowledges immediately (fire-and-forget), so the hook returns at once and
   your session is never blocked. AgentBar queues the item, badges the menu bar icon, and
   posts a notification showing what Claude is asking.
4. You answer the prompt in your terminal as usual. Clicking the banner (or the "Focus
   terminal" button in the popover) brings your terminal back to the front.

**Fail-open contract:** the CLI always returns immediately. If the app is missing,
unreachable, or errors in any way, the hook exits cleanly with no output — exactly as if
AgentBar were never installed. Because AgentBar never returns a decision to Claude Code,
every prompt is always answered in the terminal.

## Install

AgentBar has two halves — the **app** (menu bar UI) and the **plugin** (the hooks that
feed it). Install both.

### 1. App (Homebrew cask)

```sh
brew tap jreed91/claude-notification https://github.com/jreed91/claude-notification
brew install --cask agentbar
```

Then launch AgentBar once so macOS can grant it notification permission. The explicit tap
URL is required because the repository is not named `homebrew-*`.

### 2. Plugin (Claude Code marketplace)

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add jreed91/claude-notification
/plugin install agentbar@agentbar
```

The plugin's hooks activate automatically on install — no `settings.json` editing needed.

## What AgentBar shows you

Every event is a notification — AgentBar never intercepts or answers a prompt for you.

| Event | What you see | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| **Question** (`AskUserQuestion`) | The question and its options, for context | Answer in the terminal; click to focus it |
| **Permission request** | The tool and its input, so you know what Claude wants | Allow/deny in the terminal; click to focus it |
| **MCP input request** (`Elicitation`) | The server's message and the fields it wants | Fill it in the terminal; click to focus it |
| **Idle / waiting** | Claude is waiting for input | Click to focus the terminal |
| **Task finished** (`Stop`) | The turn completed | Click to focus the terminal |
| **Subagent finished** (`SubagentStop`) | A spawned subagent completed | — |
| **Session ended** (`SessionEnd`) | The session closed | — |
| **Run interrupted** (`StopFailure`) | Surfaces API errors such as rate limits, overload, or billing problems | — |

Questions, permissions, and MCP input requests stay in the popover (and badge the icon)
until you dismiss them, since there is no reply channel back into the session to clear
them automatically. The rest auto-expire. Every event has a toggle in Settings, so chatty
ones (subagent and session-end in particular) can be muted individually.

## Development

Building requires **macOS 14+ with the Xcode command line tools** (`xcode-select
--install`).

A local ad-hoc (unsigned) build installed to `/Applications`:

```sh
make bundle install
```

Other useful targets: `make build`, `make bundle`, `make adhoc`, `make clean`. See the
`Makefile` for signing, zipping, and notarizing targets.

## Commits & releasing

Releases are **fully automated** from the commit history — there is no manual tag step.

### Conventional Commits

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
The type prefix drives the next version and the generated release notes:

| Prefix | Example | Release effect |
|---|---|---|
| `fix:` | `fix: stop popover header from clipping` | patch (`0.3.0` → `0.3.1`) |
| `feat:` | `feat: add per-session mute toggle` | minor (`0.3.0` → `0.4.0`) |
| `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | `feat!: drop macOS 13 support` | major (`0.3.0` → `1.0.0`) |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `style:`, `perf:` | `chore: bump deps` | no release |

The **Lint commit messages** CI job (commitlint) enforces this on every pull request, so
non-conforming commits are caught before they reach `main`. Config lives in
`commitlint.config.js`.

### Automated releases

On every push to `main`, `release.yml` runs [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/):

1. It analyzes the commits since the last `v*` tag and decides the next version (or exits
   if nothing warrants a release).
2. `scripts/release-build.sh` builds, signs, notarizes, and zips `AgentBar.app` for that
   version and stamps `Casks/agentbar.rb`.
3. semantic-release tags `vX.Y.Z`, publishes a GitHub Release with generated notes and the
   zip asset, and commits the updated cask back to `main` (`chore(release): … [skip ci]`).

No `settings.json` or tag pushing needed — merge a `fix:`/`feat:` PR and the release ships
itself.

Required repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MACOS_CERT_P12` | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application certificate (`.p12`) |
| `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password for the `.p12` |
| `MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | Codesign identity, e.g. `Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID for notarization |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID |
| `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for notarization |
